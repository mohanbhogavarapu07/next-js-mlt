We conducted research on both Next.js and Firebase to understand their features and compatibility.
A Firebase Console account was created and successfully linked to our local machine for deployment purposes.
We deployed a test Next.js file from our local machine to the Firebase Console to verify the integration.
The testing process confirmed that our setup is functional and ready for further development.
